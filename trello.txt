Scrum teams should be looking at the chart at their daily standups, and maybe even throughout the day. \n\nBy checking if they are behind schedule or not they can decide if they are going to meet the current sprint goal. Or if they need to adjust something to complete the sprint.\n\nBy posting the burndown chart into your team's Slack channel each morning we put it front and centre for the team. No reason for anyone not to know how the sprint is going and also helps avoid the \"last day of the Sprint update\". \n\nWe also send you an email with the burndown charts for all your teams each morning. Letting you quickly keep on top of progress in the Sprints and be ready for your daily scrum.\n\n## How to create your Burndown Chart for Trello\n\nTo add a Burndown Chart to your Trello board simply\n\n1.

A quick check to see if you are on schedule or not and then move onto the board. \n\nIf you are behind schedule, look at the board and see what cards can be completed today, or moved closer to done. How can the team work together to achieve that? Maybe team members need to put the thing they were working on down for the day to work together and get something else completed and allow the burndown to get back on schedule. Remember, you don't get any burndown until each entire Card is completed. So there is more value in 2 developers fully completing one card than in the same two developers 50% completing 2 cards.\n\nIf you are behind schedule and can't see a route to getting back on track you need to consider removing Cards from the Sprint. This is preferable to allowing the team to start another card they won't have time to fix. Instead keep them focused on the most important tasks and get them all completed. Rather than starting other lower priority tasks none of which get completed.\n\nIf the team is ahead of schedule it may be time to consider adding additional tasks in. Ideally you wouldn't do this but by seeing that the team is getting ahead of the work in the Sprint early you can give Product Owners or whoever is up stream from the team time to decide what is most important to take on next.\n\n## How to use a Burndown Chart in a Retrospective?\n\nReviewing the past Burndown Chart (or charts) in your retrospective is a great idea. Scrum works best when the team gets into the habit of completing all the work in the sprint. Reviewing past burndown charts and looking for common patterns can be a great way to work out how to focus the team on completing more sprints.\n\nLook for these common patterns\n\n### Mostly on schedule during the Sprint, everything completed\n\n![Burndown on schedule all completed](https://trelloburndowns.com/public/images/pup-directory/avg.png)\n\nCongratulations! This is what you are looking for. Try to replicate whatever you did during this sprint to get it so right in future sprints\n\n### Mostly ahead of schedule for the Sprint, everything completed\n\n![Burndown ahead all completed](https://trelloburndowns.com/public/images/pup-directory/ahead.png)\n\nThis suggests the team are getting a lot of work completed early in the sprint but then only just completing the whole sprint on time. Are they adding work? Maybe they should have the confidence to commit to slightly more work up front? This pattern may not be a problem but it is worth asking why work doesn't continue to get copleted at the same rate throughout, perhaps there is something to learn\n\n### Mostly behind schedule for the Sprint but everything completed\n\n![Burndown behind all completed](https://trelloburndowns.com/public/images/pup-directory/behind.png)\n\nThis is another fairly common one where a lot of work is in progress during the sprint but comes together in the final days. This may look fine, and some teams even revel in the fact they frequently go from behind schedule to completing the sprint. However that isn't necessarily good behaviour. It could be that corners are being cut in those final days to complete the work, or the team is under pressure to work longer hours to get everything done on time. Or even just as simple as everything is in progress and comes together on the final two days but could easily slip into the next sprint if something went wrong. \n\nIf your team are regularly getting this pattern it is work looking at what is causing it. If there is pressure to meet the sprint goal on those last few days you should likely look to reduce the teams commitments in future sprints. \n\nIf however it is just that a lot of work is in progress and typically comes together on the final days of the sprint you may want to look at focussing the team on getting more work completed earlier in the sprint. A sprint with 80% of the cards fully complete is more value than a sprint with all of the cards 80% complete! Consider techniques like walking the board in standups (mentioned above) and assigning more people to individual tasks to break them up and complete them in parallel. Also, if you are seeing a delay in one specific part of your process (ie testing) you may want to review how that work is done and see if there are ways to do some of it earlier in the process\n\n### Work Completed early in the Sprint\n\n![Burndown all completed early](https://trelloburndowns.com/public/images/pup-directory/comes-together.png)\n\nThe team is likely undercomitting. There may be other bigger issues (do they thing they are being judged harshly for not completing he sprint goal?) but ultimately you need to work to buil their confidence that they can commit to more work for each sprint.\n\n### Work Not all Completed in the Sprint\n\n![Burndown not all completed](https://trelloburndowns.com/public/images/pup-directory/50-remain.png)\n\nThe team is overcommitting. Again it is likely there are larger issues to address, like maybe there is external pressure on the team trying to dictate they take more work into each sprint? Ultimately you need to reduce the amount taken into the Sprints to match what they can deliver. This may be more about managing the expectations of those putting pressure on the team than it is about the team.\n\nUltimately if you can get the team in the habit of delivering everything in the Sprint you will see motivation increase. And will likely give them more sense of control over their Sprints and an interest in improving them, rather than the \"learned helplessness\" which comes from every Sprint being destined to fail from the outset!\n\n## Top tips for Scrum Teams using Trello\n\nHere are our top tips for Scrum Teams using Trello\n\n1. Keep the same Trello Board for each Sprint. *Creating a new Board each time risks losing cards and creates unnecessary work.*\n1. Keep the same Sprint Backlog List for each Sprint, just add the new cards in as required. *Again this saves effort creating a new List each time.*\n1. *If you want to keep track of the work done in each sprint* consider creating a new Done List for each sprint. You can archive Lists when they are no longer useful.\n1. Create Lists for each step in your process. For example you may have separate Lists for Code Review and Test. *This lets you see more easily where Cards build up in your process.*\n1. Make sure the team is responsible for every step from the Sprint Backlog through to Done. *If there are steps they don't control they can't be responsible for completing those cards and will not be able to get the burndown for them.*\n1. Review your Burndown Chart at your retrospective at the end of each Sprint. Was all the work completed in the last few days? Or completed early? *Should we adjust how we tackle work (or how much we tackle) in future sprints?*\n1. Don't try to track individual member burndown, *a Scrum team works best when they work together meaning some may spend time helping others rather than burning their own work down.*\n1. Consider a 'Walking to Board' standup meeting each day if your standups are a bit stale. Walking the board means going through the cards in progress and asking what can be done today to get them completed. Once everyone has got something to do you can end the standup. If anyone doesn't talk is there a new Card they should work on? Or better to help the team with something already discussed. *This can be a great way to focus the team on completing existing work, and on working as a team.*\n1. Only burn down cards/points as each entire card is 'Done'. No burndown for partially completed work or 'hours spent'. *Scrum works best when the team is focussed on getting work done, your customer doesn't care if something is half done but they can't use it yet*\n\n## Our other Power-Ups for Trello\n\n**Corrello [Scrum and Kanban charts](https://trello.com/power-ups/568c2b6c7d2758a55ac48c98/agile-scrum-kanban-dashboards-charts-corrello)**.
